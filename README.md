# Case Study 3: Texas Death Row Last Statements Analysis

#### Authors: Diya Gupta

## Overview  
This repository contains CSV data files generated using Python scripts to scrape and clean data from the Texas Department of Criminal Justice website, specifically the Death Row Information of all 592 inmates arrested in Texas since 1982. Our dataset includes the last statements of death row inmates, scripts to clean the data and quantify remorse using sentiment analysis tools, and visualizations demonstrating early findings.  

Our project examines the amount of remorse expressed by Texas death row prisoners in their last words in relation to:  
- The amount of time spent on death row  
- The year of execution (before or after increased sentencing restrictions)  
- The type of crime committed

##  Instructions for Reproducing Results  

To replicate our results, follow these steps:  

1. To reproduce the results of this project, start by cloning the repository and downloading the requirements.txt file to ensure all the proper packages are available.
2. Run dataCleaner00, which inputs the HTML script from the TDJC website and scrapes the data into the output deathRowInitial.csv.
3. Run dataCleaner01, which inputs the HTML script from TDJC and follows and scrapes the last statement link for each input outputting them into last_statement_links.csv
4. Run dataCleaner02, which inputs the last_statement_links.csv file, and cleans it outputting the data into cleaned_last_statements.csv
5. Run dataCleaner03, which inputs deathRowInitial.csv, following the links and preceding to scrape them using configured Tesseract OCR for JPG images, as well as scraping all the info from the HTML versions outputting to inmate_infoInitial.csv.
6. Run dataCleaner04, which inputs inmate_infoInitial.csv and cleans the data from the HTML outputs, placing the cleaned data in Clean_Inmate_info.csv
